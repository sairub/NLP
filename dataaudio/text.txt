It is remarkable that multilayered integrated circuits are being manufactured successfully
High-resolution coherent diffractive imaging technique can create three-dimensional images of integrated circuits
The active transistor layer is at the bottom while other layers mainly consist of metal interconnects
The measured structure and design match perfectly
The colors of the wires in the schematic are the same as those of the wires used in the 3D rendering
The slice contains the transistor layer where we can identify repetitive structures
The tomographic imaging geometry required the extraction of cylindrical pillars from the chips that are initially flat extended objects
Xray ptychography promises to solve the chip inspection problem
This would enable optimization of production processes
There is a perfect match between the design and measured layers
Xray tomography is an invaluable tool in biomedical imaging
Most frequently such information is based on Xray attenuation
We expect this high-resolution tomography technique to provide invaluable information for both the life and material sciences
The transistor map is converted into the actual IC design
Downside of the high penetration power of Xrays is their low absorption contrast
The associated length scales cover a wide range from centimeters down to nanometers
Unlike in traditional Xray microscopy the recovered images are complex-valued map
The reconstruction does not rely on assumptions of homogeneity, negligible absorption, or small phase advance
We report the implementation of ptychographic Xray computed tomography
The resulting difference in signal-to-noise ratio is apparent in the line profiles
All measurements were performed at a photon energy 
The integrated micromanipulator was used to mount the sample on the holder for the tomography measurement
The measurement conditions were identical to those for the tomographic measurement of the pillarshaped Intel sample 
The laminography measurement geometry combined with foreseeable improvements in Xray source
The small blue circles correspond to the scanning points of the ptychographic scan
One can also clearly identify the transistor gates, but we cannot distinguish between p and n type transistors
The repetitive structures become even more evident when looking at slices
The interconnect layers are vertically connected to each other by vias with hollow interiors
Our experiments represent a major advance in chip inspection and reverse engineering
There is a growing number of applications which require both quantitative and sensitive investigation methods
